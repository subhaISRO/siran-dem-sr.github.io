            <p>DEM or Digital Elevation Model is a three dimensional model that represents
                elevation of surfaces in digital format. Trditionally, DEMs are generated
                from a pair of stereo images with photogrammetric techniques. High-resolution (HR)
                DEMs have huge significance multiple applications like disaster planning and
                city modellling. Therefore, here we focus on real world DEM SR under the guidance
                of HR multi-spectral (MX) satellite image.

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is an essential aspect in the
                remote sensing (RS) domain to analyze various applications related to
                surface elevations. Here, we address the generation of high-resolution
                (HR) DEMs using HR multi-spectral (MX) satellite imagery as a guide
                by introducing a novel hybrid transformer model consisting of Densely
                connected Multi-Residual Block (DMRB) and multi-headed Frequency
                Selective Graph Attention (M-FSGA).To promptly regulate this process,
                we utilize the notion of discriminator spatial maps as the conditional
                attention to the MX guide. Further, we present a novel adversarial ob-
                jective related to optimizing Sinkhorn distance with classical GAN. In
                this regard, we provide both theoretical and empirical substantiation of
                better performance in terms of vanishing gradient issues and numerical
                convergence. Based on our experiments on 4 different DEM datasets, we
                demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative comparisons with avail-
                able baseline methods and show that the performance of our proposed
                model is superior to others with sharper details and minimal errors.</p>

            <h4>Contributions</h4>
            <p>1. We propose a novel architecture for DEM SR based on a hybrid transformer block consisting of a Densely connected Multi-Residual Block (DMRB) and multi-headed Frequency Selective Graph Attention (M-FSGA),  which effectively utilizes information from an HR MX image as a guide by conditioning it with a discriminative spatial self-attention (DSA).</p>
            <p>2. We develop and demonstrate SiRAN, a framework based on Sinkhorn regularized adversarial learning. We provide theoretical and empirical justification for its effectiveness in resolving the vanishing gradient issue while leveraging tighter iteration complexity.</p>
            <p>3. Here, we focus on performing SR for real-world low-resolution (LR) DEM. Hence, we generate our own dataset where we take realistic coarse resolution data instead of considering bicubic downsampled HR image as input. </p>
            <p>4. We perform experiments to assess the performance of our model along with ablation studies to show the impact of the different configuration choices.</p>
